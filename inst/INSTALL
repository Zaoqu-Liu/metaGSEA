metaGSEA has been developed on MAC OSX 10.6 (snow-leopard), but has also been tested on solaris and linux.
If you intend to import the edb files within the GSEA results, then the XML library is required, which has the libxml2 dependency.
In all cases to date, a simple R CMD INSTALL metaGSEA_X.X.tar.gz should suffice.
