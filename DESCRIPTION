Title: Meta-analysis of GSEA analyses, including intra- and
    inter-experiment comparisons
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
OS_type: unix
Author: Mark Cowley
Description: A collection of R and bash code to simplify
    the down-stream analysis of GSEA results. Efficient
    methods for importing and storing GSEA outputs,
    comparing genesets within a single GSEA run, and
    comparing genesets between different GSEA runs. Useful
    visualisation is the key strength of this package,
    utilising GSEA bar plots, correspondence at the top
    (CAT) plots, and hierarchical clustering plots of
    geneset similarities. Also the ability to clean up GSEA
    output on unix-alike systems, by improving the GSEA
    pre-ranked output, and the gene tables in each GSEA
    report by including the gene symbol, description and
    hyperlinks to Entrez Gene. This has evolved into a suite
    of code for importing/exporting/subsetting many of the
    GenePattern file types (GCT, CLS, CLM, CHIP, RES, ODF)
